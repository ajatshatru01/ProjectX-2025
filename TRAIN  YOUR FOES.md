### `//: THE PREMISE`

**Train Your Foes** is not just a game; it's a proof-of-concept exploration into adaptive artificial intelligence, wrapped in a cyber-horror aesthetic. Delve into a world of digital decay and neon dread, navigating four levels of intense, precision platforming. Each stage is a trial, designed to hone your skills for the final, inevitable confrontation: a turn-based duel against a machine that learns. This is a battle of wits where the opponent's strategy is forged from the ghost of a thousand simulated battles, creating an adversary that feels truly alive and unnervingly intelligent.

### `//: CORE DIRECTIVES`

- **Precision Platforming:** Traverse four hand-crafted levels demanding skill, timing, and strategy. Each jump, each enemy, is a calculated challenge.

- **Adaptive Turn-Based Combat:** Confront a final boss in a strategic, turn-based showdown. There are no predictable patterns here—only learned responses.

- **Custom Learning AI:** Witness a Q-Learning algorithm, built from the ground up in C#, drive the boss's every move. This is not a scripted sequence; it is a demonstration of true machine learning in action.

- **Atmospheric World:** Immerse yourself in a dark, glitch-infused world, where retro-inspired pixel art meets a chilling, neon-lit aesthetic.

### `//: GHOST IN THE MACHINE`

This project stands on a foundation of modern game development and foundational AI principles.

* **Engine:** **Unity Engine (`6000.2.1f1`)** is the core framework, driving the game's physics, rendering, and logic.
* **Language:** All systems are scripted in **C#**, providing robust, object-oriented control over every aspect of the game.
* **Intelligence:** The boss AI is a custom **Q-Learning** agent. Its intelligence was not programmed, but cultivated through a bespoke, headless C# simulation that ran thousands of battle iterations.
